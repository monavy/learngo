This is my attempt at learning the Go programming language. To compile the Go scripts in this repository make sure your GOPATH environment variable is set to /path/to/learngo. If you want to add custom modules, place them in a separate directory under the src folder and make sure the first line in the Go script is package <package_name>. If GOPATH is set correctly you should be able to import "package-name" and use the module. Typically the package name and the folder under the src directory would be the same name. If they are different, then import "<src_dir_name>" and use the imported functions by calling <package_name>.<function>.
